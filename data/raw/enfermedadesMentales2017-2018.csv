I was the first woman on the team and the only mom that had ever been on the team, and honestly, because it was my first, I did not fully realize the extent of the post-partum issues, but there was also no support or recognition for them and, in fact, the additional pressure placed on me probably drove me into a worse spot for a little less than a year before I could think more clearly, recognize what was happening, etc.","Yes, I observed",,3,"I think this depends on the company.

We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services.

That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased.","It was a little difficult for me to answer some of the questions related to mental health disorders because something like post-partum related issues are often for a short period of time so it's not a lifelong depression or something you struggle with all the time, but it is a huge mental health issue (and something that's generally not covered by insurance making it even more difficult to provide resources for).",0,33,female,United States of America,Maryland,White,,United States of America,Maryland,2017-11-17 23:43:06,2017-11-19 15:57:35,1ae67df214

Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation.

To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health.  ,For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.

In other fields, these types of mental disorders are typically seen as weaknesses.  In many cases, people in other fields, through TV/sitcoms movies, etc., have been exposed to the higher incidence rates for certain issues in the tech industry, but mainly as a source of humor.  The tech industry should show that some of these issues can actually be pulled on as a source of strength, both as the direct result of the issue (say, hyper-focus perhaps) or through the strength of character that is cultivated in learning to overcome these issues/challenges.
