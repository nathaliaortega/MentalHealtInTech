Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.",Maybe,1.0,"Just identified that I knew I was going through a phase of depression, and that I appreciated that they were reacting kindly despite my terrible attitude",0.0,,6.0,6.0,1,1.0,"No, none did",N/A (none offered),None did,None did,I don't know,Same level of comfort for each,Some of my previous supervisors,1.0,A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it,At some of my previous employers,0.0,,0.0,,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6.0,Maybe/Not sure,,"Yes, I experienced",,2.0,,,1.0,35.0,female,Canada,,,Canada,

To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health.  ,For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.
